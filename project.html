<p>What is a web page? It is a file written in a format (HyperText Markup Language, or html for short) that web browsers (such as Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer) can read and display. The file itself is located on a publically-accessible directory (e.g., the "Public/html" directory of your ifs space) of a computer server connected to the Internet so that anyone can access the page. Therefore your task involves two separate steps: (a) create a file in html format; and (b) upload the file onto a computer directory accessible to others via the Internet.</p>

<h4>Different Ways to Create Web Pages</h4>

<h5>There are various ways to create a web page, including</h5>

<ol>
		<li>creating the page directly in an html editor (such as Dreamweaver, GoLive, FrontPage, etc.). For a simple tutorial on Dreamweaver, go to the UM Library KNC and their pdf tutorials:<br>
		<a href="link"> http://www.lib.umich.edu/knc/howto/guides-wd.php</a> </li>
		
		<li>copy-and-paste text from a Word Processor program into one of the html editors;</li>

		<li>use the "save as web page" function in MS Word, MS Excel, etc. (Note: this may require some further editing and clean-up by an html editor after you do this step, since creating a web page from Word is not without flaws. In particular, this approach may create a lot of extra, non-standard "html junk" that may not work well on other platforms, such as in Netscape and/or on Macs.) for detailed instructions, see <a href="link"> below:</a></li>

		<li>writing html code directly (e.g., using a text editor program).
U-M's ITCS (formerly ITD) has a very good site that can walk you through the technical steps needed to set up the space in your IFS area for a web page - all you have to do is have something to put there. <a href="link"> http://www.umich.edu/~websvcs/umweb/how-to-homepage.html</a></li>
	</ol>

	<p> Simple steps to improve your web page</p> 

	<ol>
		<li>Change font style, size and/or color. (Best stick to standard fonts, such as Helvetica, Arial or Times)</li>
		<li>Change background color and/or image. Often it is best to stick with white or a very light shade.</li>
		<li>In a long document, use anchors (links within a page) to quickly move from one section to another. Here is a link to the <a href="link">bottom of the page.</a></li>
		<li> row table, without borders.</li>
		<li>Use a table format to create a chronology/timeline of important dates (e.g., historyof <a href="link">planning)</a></li>
		<li>Insert tables, graphs, images where appropriate (properly and completely cited, of course)</li>
		<li>you can always insert links within the text itself. For example: "The homeownership policies at the <a href="link">U.S Department of Housing and Development emphasize a public/private partnership approach."</a></li>
		<li>You can also link to other student topics (see #7).</li>
		<li>List complete sources of all materials used (including, where appropriate, www links).</li>
		<li>Check spelling (most software programs allow you to do this.)</li>
		<li>Use bullets and/or numbers to organize some materials</li>
		<li>insert horizontal lines to separate different sections (see the line above this section.)</li>
		<li>Start your web page with a nice, concise narrative to help the reader orient to the page. For longer pages, a table of contents (perhaps using anchors) can be effective. You can use frames, but that can be unnecessarily complicated.</li>
</ol>
	<h4>Your IFS (Institutional File System)</h4> 
	<p>To have your web page file accessible to the web browsing public, it needs to be inside an "html" directory, which in turn is inside your "Public" directory in your ifs space (which everyone has). Your IFS space has several directories, including "Public", "Private", "mail, and "Shared". See this FAQ on your ifs space. See also this IFS overview.
Where do I put my web pages?,<a href="link">Public/html</a></p>


	<h3> How do I upload (transfer) files from my local computer onto my ifs space?</h3>

	<p> There are several ways to do this.</p> 
<ul>
	<li>Access your "H-Drive" by clicking on the "My IFS Space" icon on campus Windows XP machines. Copy (drag) files into the Public>html directory inside your ifs space.</li>
	<li>use SSH Secure Shell (Windows) or Fugu (Mac OS X). Re SSH: On campus Windows XP machines, this application is located in: Programs>Internet&Email>SSH Secure File Transfer. Your local files will be listed on the left window, and the remote files on the right window. Click on "ITD-Login" to connect to remote host. You can now upload or download files. For more info, see http://www.itd.umich.edu/help/faq/ifs/ifsconnect.html. (Note: for greater security/encryption, the university has shifted from WS_FTP to SSH for Windows, and from Fetch to Fugu for the Mac).</li>
	<li>use the built-in FTP program within Dreamweaver. (Note: this works really well for managing large sites, but is not necessary if you are just creating a few pages.) See Managing Your Site with Dreamweaver 8 (PDF)</li>
	<li>fairly new (and easy): use mfile (afs file management)</li>
</ul>

		<h3>More Advice</h3>
<ul> 
		<li> Use an index.html file for your home page</li>
		<li>Be consistent about using .html or .htm (so you don’t get confused)</li>
		<li>Set up directories (e.g., a separate directory for each class; subdirectories for image files, etc.). Use a logical site organization.</li>
		<li>Avoid spaces and funny characters in file or directory names</li>
		<li>Separate personal and private content – think of your web page as an extension of your c.v./resume</li>
		<li>Test your pages on various platforms/browsers.</li>
		<li>Check for speed of pages. Avoid excessively large image files. You can reduce the size in Photoshop. (For advanced users: Consider using interlaced .gif images).</li>
		<li>Avoid hard to read backgrounds</li>
		<li>User Dreamweaver’s site management to have a local version of your web page.</li>
		<li>Keep it simple (and avoid using frames)</li>
		<li>Think about screen size/resolution</li>
